# Machine-Learning-and-Data-Science-Projects
In this repository I have covered some core algorithms of machine learning which are being developed from scratch in Python. 
With these, we can get an idea of the underlying mathematics and working fundamentals of following supervised machine learning algorithms:
1. KNN
2. Logistic Regression
3. SVM
4. Multi-Gaussian Classification
5. Decision Tree

Apart from that, I have also covered data split into train and test, K-fold cross validation, 2-D convolution, binary classification using SVM, data preprocessing for LSTM for sentiment analysis, Gradient Descent, PCA, CNN, Monte Carlo, Markov Decision Process etc
